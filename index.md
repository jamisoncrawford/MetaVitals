# CNY Vitals Pro: Public Use Documentation

## Overview

**Background:** [CNY Vitals Pro](https://pro.cnyvitals.org/) features a number of community health indicators informed by local, state, and federal sources. While ample documentation exists for Census ACS (American Community Survey) data, how thsoe data are organized is often unclear, while locally-sourced data generally lack online documentation. We're here to help with that.
