# CNY Vitals Pro: Public Use Documentation

**Objective:** This repository is for publishing a proof of concept for hosting better documentation and metadata for select indicators on [CNY Vitals Pro](https://pro.cnyvitals.org/).

**Background:** Despite providing data sources linking Census ACS indicators to their respective tables, certain locally-sourced data have no metadata or documentation available online, including variable definitions, transformations, caveats, and units of measurement. In order to promote best practices in data sharing and reproducibility, we may expand on the contents of this repository for public use documentation to supplement poor or nonexistent documentation.
